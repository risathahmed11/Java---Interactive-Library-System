# Java---Interactive-Library-System

I developed a comprehensive Java-based interactive library system, which involved designing, implementing, testing, and documenting a fully functional object-oriented software application. Throughout the project, I applied key object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create a modular and maintainable codebase. I also utilized a unit testing framework to systematically test and debug the application, ensuring it met predefined requirements.
